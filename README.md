# INTRODUCTION

The app we'll build will be in two stages. The first stage will be an app for sending messages only viewable to
those currently logged in. We'll then build on it in the second stage to save the messages so that they are also
viewable to anyone who logs in in the future.

Following The Odin Project curriculum. Please check this project step by step configuration on [Websockets_And_ActionCable](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/rails_programming/mailers_advanced_topics/actioncable_lesson.md) on Rails.
